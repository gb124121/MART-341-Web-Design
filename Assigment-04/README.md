Basically you send a request or message to a server that has access to that content. The server then send a list of different content back to your browser and interpets what has benn sent then displays what you have searched for. Opera Gx is a new upcoming web browser that I use for all my needs.
 Markup language is a format that determines what and how that content should be displayed.Extensible Hypertext Markup Language its mainly used for mobile devices because these devices lack what it takes to acces some content so its kinda of a best case for Extensible Markup Language and Hypertext Markup Language.
