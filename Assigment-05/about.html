            Emily Rodda conceived of the Deltora Quest series as a classical quest featuring a continuing storyline told over several books. She purposely modelled the structure of the series on the structure of a video game, after noting how engaged her own children were with video games. 
            The success of Rodda's previous fantasy series, Rowan of Rin, helped Deltora Quest get published as both series take place in completely fantastic worlds: Rowan of Rin was unusual because most children's fantasy series published at that time followed the Alice in Wonderland model where contemporary children found their way into a magical world. 
            Rodda worked on the manuscript for some time before taking it to her publisher. 
            She spent time developing the world of Deltora before working on the story in great detailâ€”Rodda believes that fantasy authors must make their fictional worlds seem completely real.
