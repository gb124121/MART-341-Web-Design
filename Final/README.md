Github was defintley something I grew more knlodge of now I can cofdenlty say how to navigate through different repositories. Also a better ultilization of github then in the past.

I learned quite a few things like how to propley submit a video into a web page also music as well. And how to better use the CSS format

I tried to put my pictures and text in a certain way but the animation background I really liked was giving trouble with so I did the best I could.
