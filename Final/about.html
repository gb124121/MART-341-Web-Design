        <strong>Fun/Facts</strong> This is a site dected to telling you fun stories that happened during the productions of shows and movies you love.
		We keep update on all movies and shows that come out so you can tell that friend, professor, etc. what are some intersting stuff that happened. All sources 
		for this site are checked so you dont come out telling a false rumor or not true fact. You can even submit your own research to use in our contact tab and here at our team will
		check to see if its true and post your reseach on our site.It's a place to read and list all those maddening inconsistencies that most of have noticed at least a few of in our favourite movies and TV shows - things changing between shots, historical inaccuracies, and film crew or equipment creeping into view.

		The vast majority of the entries are submitted by visitors, and proof-read before going online. Any inaccuracies can be pointed out by other visitors who submit corrections, 
		correct spellings, etc. Many entries are backed up by screenshots, and things can be up- or down-voted to reflect accuracy and quality.From just a few entries it's grown to well 
		over 100,000 mistakes from more than 10,000 movies and TV shows, plus quotes, trivia, and more. Enjoy your time on the site, please add things you've spotted, 
		and contact Jon if you have any questions.
