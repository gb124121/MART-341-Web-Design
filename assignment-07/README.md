I've came across a few forms one was drop down boxes, radio checkmarks/buttons. To filter and find what I want on the store.
Text makes a little box for text to be enterd in so that info is avaible for the broswer. Ex: Enter your Email
Selection is a form of input that limits the users option to whats on the screen. Ex: Gender Male, Female, Other.
Button Inputs allow a interactive aspect with it funtionalty to the web design.
Ex: Next Page, Previos Page.
It was exploring the different form types in the web.
