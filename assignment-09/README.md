I do have some exprince with HTML in the past so a lot of this is almost recap with some new stuff such as putting a video in HTML. But none the less it was tricky trying to get back into it like making sure I was using all the excat phrasing so something wasnt wrong or misplaced. Markup langague was on the list of things that I did struggle with a bit though.

Im defintley excited to learn more about the styling of CSS and what really goes into it.
