The Windows and Mac OS libraries have improved, but they're still minefields of awful fonts. Web fonts are a CSS feature that allows you to specify font files to be downloaded along with your website as it is accessed, meaning that any browser that supports web fonts can have exactly the fonts you specify available to it.

A fallback font is a font which will be used if your other choices aren't usable, for example in css if we want one font we would write: font-family: font-name; but we can also set fallback fonts which would be: font-family: font-1, font-2, font-3; If Font 1 isn't available, font-2 would be used, and so on.
