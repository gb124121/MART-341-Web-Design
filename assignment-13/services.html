                <p><strong>Pc Gaming</strong> PC Gaming continues to be one of the most popular forms of video gaming despite increasingly impressive competition from both the console market and mobile gaming platforms. 
                    The PC Hardware industry alone is set to be worth $70 Billion by 2023, showing that many are still heavily invested in having the best possible hardware in their PC builds for gaming.
                    And, when it comes to PC gaming, Steam is still the platform of choice for consumers as it still sits comfortably in the top spot when it comes to video game sellers, 
                    bringing in $4.3 Billion in 2017 alone.</p>

                <p>The emergence of cloud gaming is driving the market. Recent advances in advanced cloud technology have turned the idea of cloud gaming into reality. In cloud gaming, 
                    the server, where all the games are stored, does all the computation work, which includes game scene rendering, game logic processing video encoding, and video streaming. 
                    Several companies such as Onlive, G-Cluster, StreamMyGame, Gaikai, and T5-Labs are already offering commercial cloud gaming services. This new sector is also seen as a 
                    serious competitor for the traditional game market..</p>
